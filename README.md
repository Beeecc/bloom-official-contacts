### FRONTEND:

Terminal 1 - Launch a local dev server

### BACKEND

If you're role involves touching the database, please use laravel's database features in the database folder. To learn how to use migrations/factories/seeders, watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-63ClKANsM)

First, make sure u have the database running in the server by setting up the database in phpmyadmin:

1. Turn on Apache and MySQL in XAMPP
2. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin
3. Create new database and name it 'bloom'

Second, inside the VScode terminal:
Setup the Env file

```
cp .env.example .env

php artisan key:generate
```

Go to the .env file and change the value of line 14 to 'bloom' - It should look like this `DB_DATABASE=bloom`

If you want to refresh the migration/seeder:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

```

If errors are encountered, do this next:

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

To run the laravel localhost server:

```
php artisan serve

```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
